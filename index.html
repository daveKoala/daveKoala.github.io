      <h1 id="page-title">Why I'm Building Simple Static Sites Again in 2025</h1>
      <p>After years of working with frameworks like Vue and React, and spending much of my time on backend development,
        architecture, and CI/CD, I've decided to take a step back—back to the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        This
        isn't about rejecting modern tools; it's about rediscovering the joy of building something from scratch, without
        the
        added layers of abstraction.</p>

          <p>
            In the early days of the web, a site was just a collection of files—no dependencies, no complex build steps,
            no
            JavaScript bundlers. You wrote some HTML, styled it with CSS, added a bit of JavaScript if needed, and it
            just worked.
          </p>
          <h3>
            And it worked fast.
          </h3>
          <p>Even on slow connections, these sites loaded quickly and were easy to maintain. </p>
          <p>Today, the web is more powerful than ever, but also more bloated. Many sites ship hundreds of kilobytes (or
            megabytes)
            of JavaScript just to display a few paragraphs of text. While frameworks solve real problems, they also
            introduce
            complexity that isn't always necessary—especially for content-driven, mostly static websites.
          </p>
          <h3>
            So why does this approach still make sense in 2025?
          </h3>
          <ul aria-label="Benefits of static sites">

            <li>Performance & Simplicity - No client-side hydration, no virtual DOM, no unnecessary JavaScript. Just
              fast, efficient
              pages that load instantly.</li>
            <li>
              Maintainability - A simple HTML file is easy to edit. Changes can be handled by modifying the page and
              pushing through a
              CI/CD pipeline. No dependencies to update, no breaking changes from framework upgrades.
            </li>
            <li>
              Resilience - A plain HTML page will still render even if JavaScript fails. It works across all browsers,
              even
              low-powered devices.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Joy of Creation - There's something deeply satisfying about opening an empty folder, writing a few
              lines of code,
              and seeing a fully functional website come to life. No need to configure a build system or troubleshoot
              dependency issues—just build and ship.
            </li>

          </ul>
          This isn't about nostalgia for nostalgia's sake. It's about making conscious choices. Sometimes, the simplest
          approach
          is still the best one.

            Mark Rothko was a Latvian American abstract painter. He is best known for his color field paintings that
            depicted
            irregular and painterly
            rectangular regions of color, which he produced from 1949 to 1970.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Rothko did not personally subscribe to any
            one school, he is associated with the American abstract expressionism movement of modern art.
